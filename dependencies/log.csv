Shoot me a PM if you have any ideas for fun easter eggs like the ""Eat my dongus"" or ""Sir, this is a Wendy's/Unemployment/Bread line"" ones! 

If implemented, you'll get flair and/or gold!

Edit: Lots of awesome suggestions! Looking forward to adding all these!"

Unfortunately, she's no longer here. It's hard to describe how it feels to lose someone so close at such a young age, but even after all these years, the loss is still difficult to think about. One event had such a profound impact on myself and family. It's really tough to just wrap your head around it all, how quickly life can change. Making money is awesome, but appreciate the people in your life first.

Happy Birthday Sis, 

You are dearly missed everyday."

Thinking that puts were still the play and knowing Tesla was $300 range bound from 2016-2019 (when I held stock) I thought selling the tsla calls at a loss and recovering with spy was the best decision. Then went full retard and kept buying puts for a while.

I actually had this happen some years ago. Literally all he said was ""wow"" then a slight chuckle upon opening my account.

My butthurt ass filed a complaint to corporate. tl;dr ""HOW DARE THEY SHAME MY GAMBLING ADDICTION I HAVE A JOB"" 

They made that rep leave me 2 phone messages and a letter apologizing.

I think I was handing that broker thousands of dollars in contract fees per year.

The lesson is don't work for brokerages. They will make you suck off degenerates no matter how sad."
