17,2020-11-28 05:00:21,brbcripwalking,53,"The year is 2077, you and your family are having a BYND soy turkey substitute with tempeh stuffing for dinner at MCDBKWND.

You live in your parents 6x6 Zillow basement at 77 years old and still work at an AMZN warehouse as a sex slave. This is your one vacation day allotted for 5 years.

Your investment in Dow Jones went bankrupt as the DJIA is still struggling to cross 30k. Your friends who invested in Dow Jiang, the Chinese version of the dow are now retired and drive NIOs.

TSLA is now a country in Mars and you spend your time daydreaming about being a colonist as you're driving to work in a 2030 XPEV. It is custom painted with the WSB logo, license plate reading ""BULZ R FUK""

However in order to day trip thru the solar system, Space X requires a minimum portfolio balance of $25,000. Per the law of Elon, circa 2050.

You boot up your portfolio on Robinhood2 using your iPhone 6s plus even though Apple had gone out of business in 2025 when the UN outlawed the wheel for environmental reasons. Sign is visible at their abandoned headquarters in California reading: ""Theta this now you fucking piece of shit"". Goodyear blimp crash landed and still somehow burning in the parking lot.

You attempt to connect to the restaurant's wifi since Starlink took their services offline in North America after an antitrust suit by the Republic of Exxon Mobil, formally known as Texas. They are the only state that still uses gasoline even after it was confirmed that vaping petrol causes mild insomnia.

Your account balance reads -$89.51. And a margin call message appears in your inbox. ""Please stop sending Pesos in an envelope when you make a deposit. Furthermore, We will no longer be able to receive kidneys as form of payment. Sorry for the inconvenience""

You once again average down on your PLTR $10000P 11/27/77 hoping for a gap down. Andrew Left's post on Tiktok justified your DD. It was either that or THC🐝 who were still trying to acquire energizer batteries (close race between them and Oracle/Walmart)

The market opens and PLTR tanks after the news that they will buy out Google. A stock deal like that could mean millions of issued shares.

Alex Karp and Mr. Peanut brings out a fat stack of Turkish Lira and a tanker full of diesel and trades it for boomer ass GOOGL like it was a Roblox card. PLTR closes at $10001 making sure that your puts expire worthless.

On the way to LOW for some ROPE, you are hit by a rogue NKLA going downhill. You haven't seen one of those since 2020. The year you could have loaded up on PLTR calls when it was trading for $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. You die cursing George Soros as your shitty XPEV drives itself back to the dealership for missing payments."

The decent honest people here at WSB would never engage in stuff like that. 😤  I know for sure that no one here would ever photoshop a false NIO earnings report showing big losses.  I also know that no one here would then pretend to believe it and then hype it up trying to drive the price down at open so we could all get in cheaper.  That is not the type of people that we are.  We are not scum like those amoral fucks at Citron.

Besides, PLTR knew where I was the entire time. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of CHASDAQ. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Elon to meet me at Giga Berlin in Germany. He’s been waiting for me all these years. He’s never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up.

Hold a base position in a meme stonk (AMD is my choice due to my Lord and Savior being Mama Su and also the good premiums). Sell weekly premiums and use that to build hedges with 45DTE+ way OTM puts. Buy 45DTE+ calls just $1-$2 OTM. I chose 45DTE to avoid the rapid <30DTE theta decay. Close them out when they go ITM in the first 15 days and close out your hedge-puts. Use the profits to buy SPY shares and accumulate. This allows you to also sell premiums on SPY 3 times a week when you gather 100 shares. Never sell any shares. Use those premiums to YOLO. I personally use it to day trade 0DTE options on SPY or end of day gamma lottos on OPEX days. Rinse and repeat."

Right now I have a stable job (luckier than most), and I have more money than I’ve ever had before in my life thanks to you guys. This last year has just been downhill, my job has lost a sense of purpose for me and I have little motivation, no real sense of purpose or drive anymore. I don’t know what I want to do with my life anymore. My girlfriend of 2.5 years made the decision to leave me, I was just so blind that I was steadily losing her. I have never felt so alone in this world before, and I don’t know what to do. My family is scattered all over and right now I live in fucking Alaska, and the 6 hours and decreasing amount of daylight probably isn’t helping. Any recommendations or insight guys? I’m 26 and I have never felt this way before, I was always full of drive and purpose and life, and now I just feel dead and empty inside.

Lastly, the guy running the SPAC  Niccolo de Masi knows how to make mobile addicting. It's his thing.

**$NOVS** is a SPAC that is merging with AppHarvest, an indoor farming company. AppHarvest's Board looks fantastic - Martha Stewart, JD Vance, David Lee, etc. They've also gotten a ton of media coverage because their first operational farm is in Appalachia as part of a ""bringing green jobs to economically depressed areas"" pitch. The SPAC takes care of the biggest roadblock to indoor farming - upfront capital costs. That out of the way it's looking to be really viable and they have 7 more farms in the pipeline."

Realized that you were worth it and amazing after dating whatever shitdip she was with for the last two years. Now she has FOMO for you. She is a bagholder. Guarantee she dated a shithead in the last two years and sold at a loss. 

Meanwhile your present gf has 2 years worth of equity and is quietly watching the gains roll in nice and easy. 

Id tell your present gf exactly why that ex is texting you, hand your phone to her so if she wants, she can block the number, then give her some roses, and cuddle. You'll literally be up 20% in a day."
