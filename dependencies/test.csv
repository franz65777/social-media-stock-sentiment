6,2019-12-31 14:00:46,,1,"But it's a contract. When he goes to sell it, the other party is obligated to do so. That's why it's called a contract. The brokerage isn't going to let you write a naked call you can't cover with assets or margin. If you had a naked position that went insane and you couldn't cover it with assets or margin the broker would issue a margin call and you'd be having a very uncomfortable phone conversation with them. 

> Yeah some algorithm realized how retarded his buy order was and filled it, but when he tries to sell it that's another story.

It always ties back to an entity that agreed to the other side of the contract."

The brokerage isn't going to let you write a naked call you can't cover with assets or margin. If you had a naked position that went insane and you couldn't cover it with assets or margin the broker would issue a margin call and you'd be having a very uncomfortable phone conversation with them. 

> Yeah some algorithm realized how retarded his buy order was and filled it, but when he tries to sell it that's another story.

It always ties back to an entity that agreed to the other side of the contract."
